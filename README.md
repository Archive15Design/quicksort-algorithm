# quicksort-algorithm
Attempt to implement a JavaScript quicksort algorithm.

An attempt to implement a quicksort algorithm using JavaScript that runs in O(n log n) time.

Algorithm uses a right-side pivot and tail call recursion for space optimization. It can comfortably handle a couple of million random numbers in less than a minute. It doesn't really handle repeating elements as well, so I might implement a three-way partition model in the future.
